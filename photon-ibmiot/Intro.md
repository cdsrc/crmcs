# Cloud based Real-time Monitoring and Control System
This project uses cloud platform to conduct process monitoring and control, e.g.,
additive manufacturing process monitoring and control.

## 1. Connect multiple sensors to Arduino

## 2. Use Photon as wifi module of the System

## 3. Send sensor data to cloud platform

## 4. Analyze data though cloud service

## 5. Send feed back information from cloud to Arduino controller
